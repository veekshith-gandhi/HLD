## IP Address Types

### Private IP Address
- Used for **internal network communication** (intranet).
- **Not accessible** directly from the internet.
- Unique **within a local network**, but can be reused across different networks.
- **Example:** Like an *apartment door number* — it identifies a room inside a building, but people outside cannot access it directly.

### Public IP Address
- Used for **communication over the internet**.
- **Globally unique** and accessible from outside networks.
- Assigned by an **Internet Service Provider (ISP)**.
- **Example:** Like a *home street address* — it uniquely identifies your location so others can reach you.
